            Hello! I am Japheth James D. Lumanog, I am from Philippines. My favorite food is curry and chicken adobo.
            I am currently learning html and other programming language. As I push myself to learn and expand my
            knowledge little by little I noticed the improvement of myself and it became more desirable to learn even
            further.
            I am looking forward to be a professional in this profession. I enjoy spending time with my family and
            friends, and
            I also enjoy playing sports and online games. My Goal is to be good at this profession and to be the best
            solfware
            developer in the world.
